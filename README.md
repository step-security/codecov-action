# Codecov GitHub Action

### Easily upload coverage reports to Codecov from GitHub Actions

## Usage

> [!CAUTION]
> In order for the Action to work seamlessly, you will need to have `bash`, `curl`, `git`, and `gpg` installed on your runner. You will also need to run [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) before calling the Codecov action. If these are not present, the Action will fail. Github Actions runners will have these installed by default. If you are using a custom runner or running in a container, you will need to ensure that these are installed.

To integrate Codecov with your Actions pipeline, specify the name of this repository with a tag number (`@v6` is recommended) as a `step` within your `workflow.yml` file.


This Action also requires you to [provide an upload token](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/frequently-asked-questions#where-is-the-repository-upload-token-found) from [codecov.io](https://www.codecov.io) (tip: in order to avoid exposing your token, [store it](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token#github-actions) as a `secret`).

Currently, the Action will identify linux, macos, and windows runners. However, the Action may misidentify other architectures. The OS can be specified as

- alpine
- alpine-arm64
- linux
- linux-arm64
- macos
- windows

Inside your `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` file:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v6
  - uses: step-security/codecov-action@v6
    with:
      fail_ci_if_error: true # optional (default = false)
      files: ./coverage1.xml,./coverage2.xml # optional
      flags: unittests # optional
      name: codecov-umbrella # optional
      token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
      verbose: true # optional (default = false)
```

The Codecov token can also be passed in via environment variables:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v6
  - uses: step-security/codecov-action@v6
    with:
      fail_ci_if_error: true # optional (default = false)
      files: ./coverage1.xml,./coverage2.xml # optional
      flags: unittests # optional
      name: codecov-umbrella # optional
      verbose: true # optional (default = false)
    env:
      CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This assumes that you've set your Codecov token inside _Settings > Secrets_ as `CODECOV_TOKEN`. If not, you can [get an upload token](https://docs.codecov.io/docs/frequently-asked-questions#section-where-is-the-repository-upload-token-found-) for your specific repo on [codecov.io](https://www.codecov.io). Keep in mind that secrets are _not_ available to forks of repositories.

### Using OIDC

As an alternative to Codecov upload tokens, you can choose to use OIDC as your upload authentication method by setting the `use_oidc` argument:

```yaml
- uses: step-security/codecov-action@v6
  with:
    use_oidc: true
```

Any token supplied will be ignored, as Codecov will default to the OIDC token for verification.

Note that the codecov action must have write permission for `id-token` for this to work:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
```

This can be set at either the workflow or job level. See GitHub's [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) for more details.
